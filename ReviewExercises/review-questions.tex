\section*{About This Document}
These questions are the ``bread and butter'' of Econ 103: they cover the basic knowledge that you will need to acquire this semester to pass the course. 
There are between 10 and 15 questions for each lecture.
After a given lecture, and before the next one, you should solve all of the associated review questions.
To give you an incentive to keep up with the course material, all quiz questions for the course will be randomly selected from this list.
For example Quiz \#1, which covers lectures 1--2, will consist of one question drawn at random from questions 1--10 and another drawn at random from questions 12--24 below.
We will not circulate solutions to review questions.
Compiling your own solutions is an important part of studying for the course.
We will be happy to discuss any of the review questions with you in office hours or on Piazza, and you are most welcome to discuss them with your fellow classmates.
Be warned, however, that merely memorizing answers written by a classmate is a risky strategy.
It may get you through the quiz, but will leave you woefully unprepared for the exams.
There is no curve in this course: to pass the exams you will have to learn the material covered in these questions.
Rote memorization will not suffice.

\section*{Lecture \#1 -- Introduction}
\begin{questions}

  \question Define the following terms and give a simple example: \emph{population}, \emph{sample}, \emph{sample size}.
  \question Explain the distinction between a \emph{parameter} and a \emph{statistic}.
  \question Briefly compare and contrast \emph{sampling} and \emph{non-sampling} error.
  \question Define a \emph{simple random sample}. Does it help us to address sampling error, non-sampling error, both, or neither? 

\question A drive-time radio show frequently holds call-in polls during the evening rush hour. Do you expect that results based on such a poll will be biased? Why? 
	\begin{solution}
    They will likely be biased.
		People who are listening to the radio during rush hour are disproportionately likely to be commuters driving home from work. People who are employed and drive to work are not representative of the population at large.  
	\end{solution}


\question Dylan polled a random sample of 100 college students. In total 20 of them said that they approved of President Trump. Calculate the margin of error for this poll.

%\question Suppose I deal two cards at random from a well-shuffled deck of 52 playing cards. What is the probability that I get a pair of aces? 
%	\begin{solution}
%	You can either solve this assuming that order doesn't matter:
%		$$\frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{2}} = \frac{4!/(2!\times 2!)}{52!/(50!  \times 2!)} = \frac{6}{(52\times 51)/2}= 6/1326 = 1/221$$
%		or that it does:
%		$$\frac{P^4_2}{P^{52}_2} = \frac{4!/2!}{52!/50!} =\frac{(4\times 3)}{(52\times 51)} = 12/2652 = 1/221$$

  \begin{solution}
    This solution assumes that order doesn't matter.
    You could also assume that it does matter and get the same answer.
    There are $\displaystyle {9 \choose 2} = 36$ equally likely ways to choose 2 items from a set of 9. Of these, there are $\displaystyle {5 \choose 2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 of the 5 odd numbers.

\question State and prove the \emph{complement rule}.

\question State the \emph{multiplication rule}, and compare it to the definition of conditional probability.

\begin{parts}
  \part If $A \subseteq B$ then $P(A) \geq P(B)$.
  \begin{solution}
    FALSE: this is the logical consequence rule with the inequality sign going in the \emph{wrong direction}. 
  \end{solution}
  \part For any events $A$ and $B$, $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
  \begin{solution}
    FALSE: this only holds if $A$ and $B$ are independent.
  \end{solution}
  \part For any events $A$ and $B$, $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$.
  \begin{solution}
    TRUE: this is the addition rule.
  \end{solution}

\question Suppose that $P(B) = 0.4$, $P(A|B) = 0.1$ and $P(A|B^c) = 0.9$. 
\begin{parts}

\begin{solution}
  By the law of total probability,
  \[
    P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B^c)P(B^c) = 0.1 \times 0.4 + 0.9 \times 0.6 = 0.58
  \]
\end{solution}

  \begin{solution}
    By Bayes' rule,
    \[
      P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.4}{0.58} = 2/29 \approx 0.07
    \]

\question State and prove the law of total probability for $k = 2$.

\question Find the probability of getting \emph{at least} one six if you roll a fair, six-sided die three times.
		\begin{solution}
			Using the complement rule:
				$$P(\mbox{At Least One Six}) = 1 - P(\mbox{No Sixes})$$
			And by independence:
				$$P(\mbox{No Sixes}) = 5/6 \times 5/6 \times 5/6 = 125/216$$
			Hence, 
			$$P(\mbox{At Least One Six}) = 1 - 125/216 = 91/216 \approx 0.42$$
		\end{solution}
	
%\question Suppose everyone in a class of one hundred students flips a fair coin five times.
%	\begin{parts}
%    \part What is the probability that a given student in the class gets five heads in a row? 
%			\begin{solution}
%				$(1/2)^5 = 1/32\approx 0.03$
%			\end{solution}
%	 	\part What is the probability that at least one student gets five heads in a row?
%	 	\begin{solution}
%	 	Use the complement rule: let $A$ be the event that at least one person gets five heads in a row. Calculate the probability that no one gets 5 heads in a row as follows:
%	 		$$P(A^c) = (1 - 1/2^5)^{100} = (31/32)^{100}\approx 0.04$$
%	 		Hence the desired probability is about $0.96$.
%	 	\end{solution}
%	\end{parts}

\question Suppose a couple decides to have three children. Assume that the sex of each child is independent, and the probability of a girl is $0.48$, the approximate figure in the US. 
	\begin{parts}
		\part How many basic outcomes are there for this experiment? Are they equally likely?
		\begin{solution}
			There are two possible outcomes for each birth, so by the multiplication rule for counting, the total number of possibilities is $2\times 2\times 2 = 8$.
			They are not equally likely because each child is more likely to be a boy than a girl. The outcome BBB is most likely, followed by outcomes with two boys, and then outcomes with one boy. The outcome GGG is least likely.
			\end{solution}
		\part What is the probability that the couple has \emph{at least one} girl?
			\begin{solution}
				Use the Complement Rule and independence to calculate the probability of no girls, i.e.\ all boys:
					$$0.52 \times 0.52 \times 0.52 \approx 0.14$$
				Hence, the probability of at least one girl is approximately $1 - 0.14 = 0.86$
			\end{solution}
	\end{parts}

  \question Let $A$ and $B$ be two arbitrary events. Use the addition rule and axioms of probability to establish the following results.
\begin{parts}
  \part Show that $P(A\cup B) \leq P(A) + P(B)$. (This is called \emph{Boole's Inequality}.)
  \begin{solution}
   By the Addition Rule $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$. The result follows since $P(A\cap B) \geq 0$ by the first axiom of probability.

%    \end{solution}
%    \part Calculate $P(A \cap B)$.
%    \begin{solution}
%      Since the dice roll and coin flip are independent, we have $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) = (1/2) \times (1/3) = 1/6$.

%      $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 1/2 + 1/3 -1/6 = 3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3$.

\question Let $A$ and $B$ be two mutually exclusive events such that $P(A)>0$ and $P(B)>0$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Explain why or why not.
\begin{solution} 
  They are not independent: knowing that one has occurred means that the other \emph{cannot have occurred}.
  You can also show this mathematically.
  Since $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, $P(A\cap B) = 0$.
  But independence requires that $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
  Since neither $P(A)$ nor $P(B)$ is zero, it follows that the events cannot be independent.

\question Molly the meteorologist determines that the probability of rain on Saturday is 50\%, and the probability of rain on Sunday is also 50\%.
Adam the anchorman sees Molly's forecast and summarizes it as follows:  ``According to Molly we're in for a wet weekend. There's a 100\% chance of rain this weekend: 50\% on Saturday and 50\% on Sunday.'' Is Adam correct? Why or why not? 
			\begin{solution}
				Adam is incorrect. 
        Let $A$ be the event that it rains on Saturday, $B$ be the event that it rains on Sunday, and $C$ be the event that it rains on the weekend.
        By the addition rule $P(C) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cup B)$, so Adam is only correct if $P(A\cup B) = 0$, in other words he is only correct if it is \emph{impossible} for it to rain on both Saturday and Sunday.

			\begin{solution}
				Of the 36 basic outcomes of the experiment, the pairs (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,4), and (4,3) sum to 7. Hence the probability is 1/6.
			\end{solution}
		\part Calculate $P(G)$.
			\begin{solution}
				Of the 36 basic outcomes of this experiment, the pairs (5,5), (4,6), and (6,4) sum to 10. Hence the probability is $3/36 = 1/12$.
			\end{solution}
		\part Calculate $P(F|E)$.
			\begin{solution}
			By the definition of conditional probability,
			 $$P(F|E) = \frac{P(F\cap E)}{P(E)}$$
			 We know that $P(E) = 1/6$. The only way that $F\cap E$ can occur is if we roll (5,7). Hence $P(F\cap E) = 1/36$. Thus, $P(F|E) = (1/36)/(1/6) = 6/36 = 1/6$.
			\end{solution}
		\part Calculate $P(G|E)$.
			\begin{solution}
				Again, by the definition of conditional probability,
					$$P(G|E) = \frac{P(G\cap E)}{P(E)}$$
				As before, $P(E) = 1/6$. The only way for $G\cap E$ to occur is if we roll (5,5). Hence $P(G|E) = (1/36)/(1/6) = 6/36 = 1/6$.

\question Of women who undergo regular mammograms, two percent have breast cancer. If a woman has breast cancer, there is a 90\% chance that her mammogram will come back positive. If she does \emph{not} have breast cancer there is a 10\% chance that her mammogram will come back positive. Given that a woman's mammogram has come back positive, what is the probability that she has breast cancer? 
	\begin{solution}
		 Let $B$ be the event that a given woman has breast cancer and $M$ be the event that her mammogram comes back positive. By Bayes' Rule,
		 		\[
          P(B|M) = \frac{P(M|B)P(B)}{P(M)}
        \]
	By the law of total probability, 
		 			\begin{align*}
		 			P(M) &= P(M|B)P(B) + P(M|B^c)P(B^c)\\
		 				&= 0.9 \times 0.02 + 0.1 \times 0.98  = 0.018 + 0.098 = 0.116
		 			\end{align*}
		 	Hence,
		 		\[
          P(B|M) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.02}{0.116} = \frac{0.018}{0.116} \approx 0.16

%  \question Sherlock Holmes has gone away on vacation, instructing Dr.\ Watson to water the flowers in his absence. 
%  Unfortunately Watson has a rather poor memory: the probability that he will remember to water the flowers is only 2/3.
%  The flowers weren't in the best shape when Holmes left: even if watered the probability that they will wither and die before Holmes returns is 1/2.
%  If they aren't watered, the probability that they will wither and die increases to 3/4. 
%  Holmes returns to find that his flowers have died.
%  What is the probability that Watson forgot to water them?
%  \begin{solution}
%    By Bayes' Rule:
%    \begin{equation*}
%      P(\mbox{Forget}|\mbox{Die}) = \frac{P(\mbox{Die}|\mbox{Forget})P(\mbox{Forget})}{P(\mbox{Die})}
%    \end{equation*}
%    We calculate the denominator using the law of total probability as follows:
%    \begin{eqnarray*}
%      P(\mbox{Die}) &=& P(\mbox{Die}|\mbox{Forget})P(\mbox{Forget})+ P(\mbox{Die}|\mbox{Remember})P(\mbox{Remember})\\
%      &=& 3/4 \times 1/3 + 1/2 \times 2/3 = 3/12 + 2/6 = 7/12
%    \end{eqnarray*}
%    Thus $P(\mbox{Forget}|\mbox{Die}) = (3/12)/(7/12) = 3/7$.
%    It is more likely than not that Watson forgot to water the flowers.

%\question I have two six-sided dice in my pocket: one fair die and one loaded die. The fair die has the usual probabilities, but the probability of getting a 6 when rolling the loaded die is 1/2. Suppose I reach into my pocket and draw one of the two dice at random (both are equally likely to be drawn). I roll this randomly chosen die and get a 6. What is the probability that I drew the loaded die? 
%	\begin{solution}
%		Let $L$ be the event that I draw the loaded die, $F$ be the event that I draw the fair die and $6$ be the event that I roll a six. By Bayes' rule, we have
%			$$P(L|6) = \frac{P(6|L)P(L)}{P(6)}$$
%Calculating the denominator by the Law of Total Probability, we have
%		\begin{eqnarray*}			
%			P(6) &=& P(6|L)P(L) + P(6|F)P(F) \\
%			&=& 1/2 \times 1/2 + 1/6\times 1/2\\
%			&=&	1/4 + 1/12 \\
%			&=& 1/3		
%			\end{eqnarray*}
%		Hence,
%			$$P(L|6) = \frac{1/4}{1/3} = 3/4 = 0.75$$

Two percent of the children in the city live in the Triangle, and fourteen percent of these children test positive for excessive presence of toxic metals in the tissue. For children in the city who do not live in the Triangle, the rate of positive tests is only one percent. If we randomly select a child who lives in the city and she tests positive, what is the probability that she lives in the Triangle?
		\begin{solution}
		By the law of total probability
		\begin{align*}
		P(M) &= P(M|T)P(T) + P(M|T^c)P(T^c)\\
			&= 0.14 \times 0.02 +  0.01 \times 0.98\\

		Suppose we randomly choose an orange from the supermarket and see that it is rotten. What is the probability that it is a \emph{Tropicana}?
		\begin{solution}
			By the law of total probability:
				\begin{align*}
				P(R) &= P(R|T)P(T) + P(R|T^c)P(T^c)\\
					&= 0.03 \times 0.4 + 0.06 \times 0.6\\
					&= 0.012 + 0.036 \\

\question Substitute $n=1$ into the pmf of a Binomial$(n,p)$ RV and show that you obtain the pmf of a Bernoulli$(p)$ RV.
	\begin{solution}
		The pmf for a Binomial$(n,p)$ RV is
		$$p(x) = {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$
		with support $\{0, 1, 2\hdots, n\}$. Setting $n=1$ gives,

\question This question refers to the prediction market example from lecture. Imagine it is October 2012. Let $O$ be a contract paying \$10 if Obama wins the election, zero otherwise, and $R$ be a contract paying \$10 if Romney wins the election, zero otherwise. Let $\mbox{Price}(O)$ and $\mbox{Price}(R)$ be the respective prices of these contracts.
	\begin{parts}
	\part Suppose you \emph{buy} one of each contract. What is your profit?
		\begin{solution}
			Regardless of whether Romney or Obama wins, you get \$10. Thus, your profit is $$10 - \mbox{Price}(O) - \mbox{Price}(R)$$
		\end{solution}
	\part Suppose you \emph{sell} one of each contract. What is your profit?
		\begin{solution}
			Regardless of whether Romney or Obama wins, you have to pay out \$10. Thus, your profit is $$\mbox{Price}(O) + \mbox{Price}(R) - 10$$
		\end{solution}
	 \part What must be true about $\mbox{Price}(O)$ and $\mbox{Price}(R)$, to prevent an opportunity for statistical arbitrage? 
	 \begin{solution}
	  From (a) we see that you can earn a guaranteed, risk-free profit from \emph{buying} one of each contract whenever $10 > \mbox{Price}(O) +\mbox{Price}(R)$. From (b) we see that you can earn a guaranteeed, risk-free profit by \emph{selling} one of each contract whenever $ \mbox{Price}(O) +\mbox{Price}(R) > 10$. Therefore, the only way to prevent statistical arbitrage is to have $\mbox{Price}(O) +\mbox{Price}(R) = 10$.
	 \end{solution}
	 \part How is your answer to part (c) related to the Complement Rule?
	 	\begin{solution}
	 	In class we discussed how the market price of a prediction contract can be viewed as a subjective probability assessment. To find the implied probability we divide the price of the contract by the amount that is pays out, in this case \$10. Hence, dividing through by \$10, we see that the condition from part (b) when stated in probability terms is
	 	$$P(O) = 1 - P(R)$$
	 	This is precisely the Complement Rule because $R = O^c$.
	 	\end{solution}
	 \part What is the implicit assumption needed for your answers to parts (a)--(c) to be correct? How would your answers change if we were to relax this assumption?
	 	\begin{solution}
	 	The above discussion assumes that the only possible outcomes are Obama or Romney winning the election, that is $O \cup R = S$. This is equivalent to assuming that the probability of a third-party candidate winning the election is zero. If this assumption is not true, we need to redo the above with an extra contract. Let $I$ be a contract that pays out \$10 if a third-party (i.e.\ independent) candidate wins the election, zero otherwise. Then the answers to the above become:
	 		\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	 			\item $10 - \mbox{Price}(O) - \mbox{Price}(R) -\mbox{Price}(I) $
	 			\item  $\mbox{Price}(O) + \mbox{Price}(R) +\mbox{Price}(I) - 10$
	 			\item $\mbox{Price}(O) + \mbox{Price}(R) +\mbox{Price}(I) = 10$
	 			\item The Complement Rule becomes:
	 				$$P(I) = 1 - P(O) - P(R)$$
	 		\end{enumerate}
	 	\end{solution}

\question You have been entered into a very strange tennis tournament. To get the \$10,000 Grand Prize you must win at least two sets \emph{in a row} in a three-set series to be played against your Econ 103 professor and Venus Williams alternately: professor-Venus-professor or Venus-professor-Venus according to your choice. Let $p$ be the probability that you win a set against your professor and $v$ be the probability that you win a set against Venus. Naturally $p>v$ since Venus is much better than your professor! Assume that each set is independent.
	\begin{parts}
		\part Let W indicate win and L indicate lose, so that the sequence WWW means you win all three sets, WLW means you win the first and third set but lose the middle one, and so on. Which sequences of wins and losses land you the Grand Prize? 
			\begin{solution}
			To get the prize, you have to win the middle set. Thus, the only possibilities are WWW, WWL, and LWW.
			\end{solution}
		\part If you elect to play the middle set against Venus, what is the probability that you win the Grand Prize?
		\begin{solution}
		The probabilities of mutually exclusive events sum. Thus,
				\begin{eqnarray*}
		P(WWW) + P(LWW) + P(WWL) &=& pvp + (1-p)vp +pv(1-p)\\

		\part If you elect to play the middle set against your professor, what is the probability that you win the Grand prize? 
				\begin{solution}
		Again, the probabilities of mutually exclusive events sum. Thus,
				\begin{eqnarray*}
		P(WWW) + P(LWW) + P(WWL) &=& vpv + (1-v)pv +vp(1-v)\\	
		&=&v^2 p + vp - v^2 p + vp - v^2 p\\
		&=& 2pv -v^2p\\
		&=& pv(2-v)
		\end{eqnarray*}
		\end{solution}
	\part[5] To maximize your chance of winning the prize, should you choose to play the middle set against Venus or your professor?
	\begin{solution}
	Manipulating the inequality,
		\begin{eqnarray*}
			p &>& v\\
			-p &<& -v\\
			2-p &<& 2-v\\
			pv(2-p) &<& pv(2-v)\\
		\end{eqnarray*}
		You can't get the prize without winning the middle set, so it turns out that it's better to face Venus twice rather than face her in the middle set. You should elect to play the middle set against your professor.

\question Rossa and Rodrigo are playing their favorite game: matching pennies.
The game proceeds as follows.
In each round, both players flip a penny.
If the flips match (TT or HH) Rossa gets one point; if the flips do not match (TH or HT) Rodrigo gets one point.
The game is best of three rounds: as soon as one of the players reaches two points, the game ends and that player is declared the winner.
Since there's a lot of money on the line and graduate students aren't paid particularly well, Rossa secretly alters each of the pennies so that the probability of heads is 2/3 rather than 1/2.
In spite of Rossa's cheating, the individual coin flips remain independent.
 	\begin{parts} 
    \part[6] Calculate the probability that Rossa will win the first round of this game.
    \begin{solution}
      Rossa wins a given round if either of the two mutually exclusive outcomes $HH$ or $TT$ occurs.
      Thus:
      $$P(\mbox{Rossa Wins}) = P(HH) + P(TT) = (2/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 = 5/9$$ 
    \end{solution}
    \part Calculate the probability that the game will last for a full three rounds.
    \begin{solution}
      We need to calculate the probability of a tie after two rounds.
      There are two ways that a tie could occur: either Rossa wins the first round while Rodrigo wins the second, or Rodrigo wins the first round while Rossa wins the second.
      These two events are mutually exclusive and the probability of each is $5/9 \times 4/9 = 20/81$ since successive coin flips are independent.
      Thus, the desired probability is $40/81$.
    \end{solution}
    \part Calculate the probability that Rodrigo will win the game.
    \begin{solution}
      Rodrigo needs to win two rounds to win the game. 
      There are three ways this can happen.
      First, Rodrigo could win both rounds 1 and 2, in which case no third round is played.
      The probability of this event is $4/9 \times 4/9 = 16/81$.
      Second Rodrigo could lose round 1 but win rounds 2 and 3.
      The probability of this event is $5/9 \times 4/9 \times 4/9 = 80/729$.
      Finally, Rodrigo could lose round 2 but win rounds 1 and 3.
      The probability of this event is $4/9 \times 5/9 \times 4/9 = 80/729$.
      Summing these probabilities, since their corresponding events are mutually exclusive, the probability that Rodrigo wins the game is $304/729\approx 0.417$.
    \end{solution}
    \part Yiwen is walking down the hallway and sees Rodrigo doing his victory dance: clearly Rossa has lost in spite of rigging the game.
    Given that Rodrigo won, calculate the probability that the game lasted for three rounds.
    \begin{solution}
      By the definition of conditional probability,
      \begin{equation*}
        P(\mbox{3 Rounds}|\mbox{Rodrigo Won}) = \frac{P(\mbox{3 Rounds} \cap \mbox{Rodrigo Won})}{P(\mbox{Rodrigo Won})}
      \end{equation*}
      We already calculated the denominator in the preceding part: it equals $304/729$.
      To calculate the numerator we simply add up the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive ways in which Rodrigo could win in three rounds: (Win, Lose, Win) and (Lose, Win, Win).
      We calculated these probabilities in the preceding part: both were $80/729$ so the numerator is $160/729$.
      Taking the ratio of these gives $160/304 \approx 0.526$.
      Given that Rodrigo won, it is slightly more likely than not that the game lasted for a full three rounds.
    \end{solution}

\question A plane has crashed in one of three possible locations: the mountains ($M$), the desert ($D$), or the sea ($S$).
Based on its flight path, experts have calculated the following prior probabilities that the plane is in each location: $P(M) = 0.5$, $P(D) = 0.3$ and $P(S) = 0.2$.
If we search the mountains then, given that the plane is actually there, we have a 30\% chance of \emph{failing} to find it.
If we search the desert then, given that the plane is actually there, we have a 20\% chance of \emph{failing} to find it.
Finally, if we search the sea then, given that the plane is actually there, we have a 90\% chance of \emph{failing} to find it. 
Naturally if the plane is \emph{not} in a particular location but we search for it there, we will not find it.
You may assume that searches in each location are independent.
Let $F_M$ be the event that we \emph{fail} to find the plane in the mountains.
Define $F_D$ and $F_S$ analogously.
\begin{parts}
  \part[10] We started by searching the mountains.
  We did not find the plane.
  What is the conditional probability that the plane is nevertheless in the mountains?
  Explain.
  \begin{solution}
    By Bayes' Rule: $P(M|F_M) = P(F_M|M)P(M)/P(F_M)$.
    We first calculate the denominator using the Law of Total Probability:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      P(F_M) &=&  P(F_M|M)P(M) + P(F_M|M^C)P(M^C) \\
      &=& 0.3 \times 0.5 + 1 \times 0.5 = 0.15 + 0.5 = 0.65
    \end{eqnarray*}
    Hence, the desired probability is $15/65 = 3/13 \approx 0.23$.
  \end{solution}
\part[20] After failing to find the plane in the mountains, we searched the desert, and the sea.
  We did not find the plane in either location.
  After this more exhaustive search what is the conditional probability that the plane is in the mountains?
  Explain.
  \begin{solution}
    We are asked to calculate $P(M|F_M \cap F_D \cap F_S)$.
    By Bayes' rule, 
    $$P(M|F_M \cap F_D \cap F_S) = \frac{P(F_M \cap F_D \cap F_S|M)P(M)}{P(F_M \cap F_D \cap F_S)}$$
    Define the shorthand $A = F_M \cap F_D \cap F_S$. 
    By the Law of Total Probability
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      P(A) &=& P(A|M)P(M) + P(A|D)P(D) + P(A|S)P(S) \\
      &=& (0.3 \times 1 \times 1) \times 0.5 + (1 \times 0.2 \times 1) \times 0.3 + (1 \times 1 \times 0.9 ) \times 0.2 \\
      &=&  0.15 + 0.06 + 0.18 = 0.39
    \end{eqnarray*}
    using independence.
    Hence, the desired probability is $15/39 \approx 0.38$.
  \end{solution}

  \question I have an urn that contains two red balls and three blue balls.
  I offer you the chance to play the following game. You draw one ball at a time from the urn. Draws are made at random and \emph{without replacement}. You win \$1 for each red ball that you draw, but lose \$1 for each blue ball that you draw. You are allowed to stop the game at any point. Find a strategy that ensures your expected value from playing this game is \emph{positive}. 

  \question An ancient artifact worth \$100,000 fell out of Indiana Jones's airplane and landed in the Florida Everglades. Unless he finds it within a day, it will sink to the bottom and be lost forever. Dr.\ Jones can hire one or more helicopters to search the Everglades. Each helicopter charges \$1000 per day and has a probability of 0.9 of finding the artifact. If Dr.\ Jones wants to maximize his \emph{expected value}, how many helicopters should he hire?
