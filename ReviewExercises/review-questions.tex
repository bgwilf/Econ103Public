\section*{About This Document}
These questions are the ``bread and butter'' of Econ 103: they cover the basic knowledge that you will need to acquire this semester to pass the course. 
There are between 10 and 15 questions for each lecture.
After a given lecture, and before the next one, you should solve all of the associated review questions.
To give you an incentive to keep up with the course material, all quiz questions for the course will be randomly selected from this list.
For example Quiz \#1, which covers lectures 1--2, will consist of one question drawn at random from questions 1--10 and another drawn at random from questions 12--24 below.
We will not circulate solutions to review questions.
Compiling your own solutions is an important part of studying for the course.
We will be happy to discuss any of the review questions with you in office hours or on Piazza, and you are most welcome to discuss them with your fellow classmates.
Be warned, however, that merely memorizing answers written by a classmate is a risky strategy.
It may get you through the quiz, but will leave you woefully unprepared for the exams.
There is no curve in this course: to pass the exams you will have to learn the material covered in these questions.
Rote memorization will not suffice.

\section*{Lecture \#1 -- Introduction}
\begin{questions}
  \question Define the following terms and give a simple example: \emph{population}, \emph{sample}, \emph{sample size}.
  \question Explain the distinction between a \emph{parameter} and a \emph{statistic}.
  \question Briefly compare and contrast \emph{sampling} and \emph{non-sampling} error.
  \question Define a \emph{simple random sample}. Does it help us to address sampling error, non-sampling error, both, or neither? 

\question A drive-time radio show frequently holds call-in polls during the evening rush hour. Do you expect that results based on such a poll will be biased? Why? 
	\begin{solution}
    They will likely be biased.
		People who are listening to the radio during rush hour are disproportionately likely to be commuters driving home from work. People who are employed and drive to work are not representative of the population at large.  
	\end{solution}


\question Dylan polled a random sample of 100 college students. In total 20 of them said that they approved of President Trump. Calculate the margin of error for this poll.

  \question Based on information from an observational dataset, Amy finds that students who attend an SAT prep class score, on average, 100 points better on the exam than students who do not. In this example, what would be required for a variable to \emph{confound} the relationship between SAT prep classes and exam performance? What are some possible confounders?

	\begin{solution}
	You can either solve this assuming that order doesn't matter:
		$$\frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{2}} = \frac{4!/(2!\times 2!)}{52!/(50!  \times 2!)} = \frac{6}{(52\times 51)/2}= 6/1326 = 1/221$$
		or that it does:
		$$\frac{P^4_2}{P^{52}_2} = \frac{4!/2!}{52!/50!} =\frac{(4\times 3)}{(52\times 51)} = 12/2652 = 1/221$$
		In either case, the answer is the same: $1/221  \approx 0.005$
	\end{solution}

  \question Suppose that I choose two numbers at random from the set $\left\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \right\}$. What is the probability that both are odd?
  \begin{solution}
    This solution assumes that order doesn't matter.
    You could also assume that it does matter and get the same answer.
    There are $\displaystyle {9 \choose 2} = 36$ equally likely ways to choose 2 items from a set of 9. Of these, there are $\displaystyle {5 \choose 2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 of the 5 odd numbers.
    Hence the probability is $10/36 = 5/18$.
  \end{solution}
