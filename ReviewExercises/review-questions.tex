\section*{About This Document}
These questions are the ``bread and butter'' of Econ 103: they cover the basic knowledge that you will need to acquire this semester to pass the course. 
There are between 10 and 15 questions for each lecture.
After a given lecture, and before the next one, you should solve all of the associated review questions.
To give you an incentive to keep up with the course material, all quiz questions for the course will be randomly selected from this list.
For example Quiz \#1, which covers lectures 1--2, will consist of one question drawn at random from questions 1--10 and another drawn at random from questions 12--24 below.
We will not circulate solutions to review questions.
Compiling your own solutions is an important part of studying for the course.
We will be happy to discuss any of the review questions with you in office hours or on Piazza, and you are most welcome to discuss them with your fellow classmates.
Be warned, however, that merely memorizing answers written by a classmate is a risky strategy.
It may get you through the quiz, but will leave you woefully unprepared for the exams.
There is no curve in this course: to pass the exams you will have to learn the material covered in these questions.
Rote memorization will not suffice.

\section*{Lecture \#1 -- Introduction}
\begin{questions}

  \question Define the following terms and give a simple example: \emph{population}, \emph{sample}, \emph{sample size}.
  \question Explain the distinction between a \emph{parameter} and a \emph{statistic}.
  \question Briefly compare and contrast \emph{sampling} and \emph{non-sampling} error.
  \question Define a \emph{simple random sample}. Does it help us to address sampling error, non-sampling error, both, or neither? 

\question A drive-time radio show frequently holds call-in polls during the evening rush hour. Do you expect that results based on such a poll will be biased? Why? 
	\begin{solution}
    They will likely be biased.
		People who are listening to the radio during rush hour are disproportionately likely to be commuters driving home from work. People who are employed and drive to work are not representative of the population at large.  
	\end{solution}

%	You can either solve this assuming that order doesn't matter:
%		$$\frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{2}} = \frac{4!/(2!\times 2!)}{52!/(50!  \times 2!)} = \frac{6}{(52\times 51)/2}= 6/1326 = 1/221$$
%		or that it does:
%		$$\frac{P^4_2}{P^{52}_2} = \frac{4!/2!}{52!/50!} =\frac{(4\times 3)}{(52\times 51)} = 12/2652 = 1/221$$

    This solution assumes that order doesn't matter.
    You could also assume that it does matter and get the same answer.
    There are $\displaystyle {9 \choose 2} = 36$ equally likely ways to choose 2 items from a set of 9. Of these, there are $\displaystyle {5 \choose 2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 of the 5 odd numbers.

  \end{solution}
  \part For any events $A$ and $B$, $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
  \begin{solution}

  \end{solution}
  \part For any events $A$ and $B$, $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$.

    By Bayes' rule,
    \[
      P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{0.1 \times 0.4}{0.58} = 2/29 \approx 0.07
    \]
  \end{solution}

		\begin{solution}
			Using the complement rule:
				$$P(\mbox{At Least One Six}) = 1 - P(\mbox{No Sixes})$$
			And by independence:
				$$P(\mbox{No Sixes}) = 5/6 \times 5/6 \times 5/6 = 125/216$$
			Hence, 
			$$P(\mbox{At Least One Six}) = 1 - 125/216 = 91/216 \approx 0.42$$

%\question Suppose everyone in a class of one hundred students flips a fair coin five times.

%				$(1/2)^5 = 1/32\approx 0.03$
%			\end{solution}
%	 	\part What is the probability that at least one student gets five heads in a row?
%	 	\begin{solution}
%	 	Use the complement rule: let $A$ be the event that at least one person gets five heads in a row. Calculate the probability that no one gets 5 heads in a row as follows:
%	 		$$P(A^c) = (1 - 1/2^5)^{100} = (31/32)^{100}\approx 0.04$$
%	 		Hence the desired probability is about $0.96$.
%	 	\end{solution}
%	\end{parts}

\question Suppose a couple decides to have three children. Assume that the sex of each child is independent, and the probability of a girl is $0.48$, the approximate figure in the US. 
	\begin{parts}
		\part How many basic outcomes are there for this experiment? Are they equally likely?
		\begin{solution}
			There are two possible outcomes for each birth, so by the multiplication rule for counting, the total number of possibilities is $2\times 2\times 2 = 8$.
			They are not equally likely because each child is more likely to be a boy than a girl. The outcome BBB is most likely, followed by outcomes with two boys, and then outcomes with one boy. The outcome GGG is least likely.
			\end{solution}
		\part What is the probability that the couple has \emph{at least one} girl?

  \question Let $A$ and $B$ be two arbitrary events. Use the addition rule and axioms of probability to establish the following results.
\begin{parts}
  \part Show that $P(A\cup B) \leq P(A) + P(B)$. (This is called \emph{Boole's Inequality}.)
  \begin{solution}
   By the Addition Rule $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$. The result follows since $P(A\cap B) \geq 0$ by the first axiom of probability. 
  \end{solution}
  \part Show that $P(A\cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1$. (This is called \emph{Bonferroni's Inequality})
  \begin{solution}
   Rearranging the Addition Rule, $P(A\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cup B)$. The result follows since $P(A\cup B)$ is at most one by the first axiom of probability.
  \end{solution}

%\question Suppose I flip a fair coin and roll a single fair die at the same time. Define the events 
%\\ $A =$ the coin comes up tails 
%\\ $B =$ the die shows a 3 \emph{or} 5
%\\ $C =$ the die shows an \emph{odd} number 
% 	\begin{parts} 
%    \part Calculate $P(B|C)$.
%    \begin{solution}
%      \[P(B|C) = P(B\cap C)/P(C) =  (1/3)/(1/2) = 2/3\] 
%    \end{solution}
%    \part Calculate $P(A \cap B)$.
%    \begin{solution}
%      Since the dice roll and coin flip are independent, we have $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) = (1/2) \times (1/3) = 1/6$. 
%    \end{solution}
%    \part Calculate $P(A \cup B)$.
%    \begin{solution}
%      $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 1/2 + 1/3 -1/6 = 3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3$.

\question Let $A$ and $B$ be two mutually exclusive events such that $P(A)>0$ and $P(B)>0$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Explain why or why not.
\begin{solution} 
  They are not independent: knowing that one has occurred means that the other \emph{cannot have occurred}.
  You can also show this mathematically.
  Since $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, $P(A\cap B) = 0$.
  But independence requires that $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
  Since neither $P(A)$ nor $P(B)$ is zero, it follows that the events cannot be independent.

\question Molly the meteorologist determines that the probability of rain on Saturday is 50\%, and the probability of rain on Sunday is also 50\%.
Adam the anchorman sees Molly's forecast and summarizes it as follows:  ``According to Molly we're in for a wet weekend. There's a 100\% chance of rain this weekend: 50\% on Saturday and 50\% on Sunday.'' Is Adam correct? Why or why not? 
			\begin{solution}
				Adam is incorrect. 
        Let $A$ be the event that it rains on Saturday, $B$ be the event that it rains on Sunday, and $C$ be the event that it rains on the weekend.
        By the addition rule $P(C) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$, so Adam is only correct if $P(A\cap B) = 0$, in other words he is only correct if it is \emph{impossible} for it to rain on both Saturday and Sunday. There is no way to know that this is the case solely from Molly's information about the probabilities of $A$ and $B$.

\question Suppose I throw two fair, six-sided dice once. Define the following events:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		E &=& \mbox{The first die shows 5}\\
		F &=& \mbox{The sum of the two dice equals 7}\\
		G &=& \mbox{The sum of the two dice equals 10}
	\end{eqnarray*}
	\begin{parts}
		\part Calculate $P(F)$.
			\begin{solution}
				Of the 36 basic outcomes of the experiment, the pairs (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,4), and (4,3) sum to 7. Hence the probability is 1/6.
			\end{solution}
		\part Calculate $P(G)$.
			\begin{solution}
				Of the 36 basic outcomes of this experiment, the pairs (5,5), (4,6), and (6,4) sum to 10. Hence the probability is $3/36 = 1/12$.
			\end{solution}
		\part Calculate $P(F|E)$.
			\begin{solution}
			By the definition of conditional probability,
			 $$P(F|E) = \frac{P(F\cap E)}{P(E)}$$
			 We know that $P(E) = 1/6$. The only way that $F\cap E$ can occur is if we roll (5,7). Hence $P(F\cap E) = 1/36$. Thus, $P(F|E) = (1/36)/(1/6) = 6/36 = 1/6$.
			\end{solution}
		\part Calculate $P(G|E)$.
			\begin{solution}
				Again, by the definition of conditional probability,
					$$P(G|E) = \frac{P(G\cap E)}{P(E)}$$
				As before, $P(E) = 1/6$. The only way for $G\cap E$ to occur is if we roll (5,5). Hence $P(G|E) = (1/36)/(1/6) = 6/36 = 1/6$.

\question Of women who undergo regular mammograms, two percent have breast cancer. If a woman has breast cancer, there is a 90\% chance that her mammogram will come back positive. If she does \emph{not} have breast cancer there is a 10\% chance that her mammogram will come back positive. Given that a woman's mammogram has come back positive, what is the probability that she has breast cancer? 
	\begin{solution}
		 Let $B$ be the event that a given woman has breast cancer and $M$ be the event that her mammogram comes back positive. By Bayes' Rule,
		 		\[
          P(B|M) = \frac{P(M|B)P(B)}{P(M)}
        \]
	By the law of total probability, 
		 			\begin{align*}
		 			P(M) &= P(M|B)P(B) + P(M|B^c)P(B^c)\\
		 				&= 0.9 \times 0.02 + 0.1 \times 0.98  = 0.018 + 0.098 = 0.116
		 			\end{align*}
		 	Hence,
		 		\[
          P(B|M) = \frac{0.9 \times 0.02}{0.116} = \frac{0.018}{0.116} \approx 0.16
        \]

%  \question Sherlock Holmes has gone away on vacation, instructing Dr.\ Watson to water the flowers in his absence. 
%  Unfortunately Watson has a rather poor memory: the probability that he will remember to water the flowers is only 2/3.
%  The flowers weren't in the best shape when Holmes left: even if watered the probability that they will wither and die before Holmes returns is 1/2.
%  If they aren't watered, the probability that they will wither and die increases to 3/4. 
%  Holmes returns to find that his flowers have died.
%  What is the probability that Watson forgot to water them?
%  \begin{solution}
%    By Bayes' Rule:
%    \begin{equation*}
%      P(\mbox{Forget}|\mbox{Die}) = \frac{P(\mbox{Die}|\mbox{Forget})P(\mbox{Forget})}{P(\mbox{Die})}
%    \end{equation*}
%    We calculate the denominator using the law of total probability as follows:
%    \begin{eqnarray*}
%      P(\mbox{Die}) &=& P(\mbox{Die}|\mbox{Forget})P(\mbox{Forget})+ P(\mbox{Die}|\mbox{Remember})P(\mbox{Remember})\\
%      &=& 3/4 \times 1/3 + 1/2 \times 2/3 = 3/12 + 2/6 = 7/12
%    \end{eqnarray*}
%    Thus $P(\mbox{Forget}|\mbox{Die}) = (3/12)/(7/12) = 3/7$.
%    It is more likely than not that Watson forgot to water the flowers.

%\question I have two six-sided dice in my pocket: one fair die and one loaded die. The fair die has the usual probabilities, but the probability of getting a 6 when rolling the loaded die is 1/2. Suppose I reach into my pocket and draw one of the two dice at random (both are equally likely to be drawn). I roll this randomly chosen die and get a 6. What is the probability that I drew the loaded die? 
%	\begin{solution}
%		Let $L$ be the event that I draw the loaded die, $F$ be the event that I draw the fair die and $6$ be the event that I roll a six. By Bayes' rule, we have
%			$$P(L|6) = \frac{P(6|L)P(L)}{P(6)}$$
%Calculating the denominator by the Law of Total Probability, we have
%		\begin{eqnarray*}			
%			P(6) &=& P(6|L)P(L) + P(6|F)P(F) \\
%			&=& 1/2 \times 1/2 + 1/6\times 1/2\\
%			&=&	1/4 + 1/12 \\
%			&=& 1/3		
%			\end{eqnarray*}
%		Hence,
%			$$P(L|6) = \frac{1/4}{1/3} = 3/4 = 0.75$$

\question The Triangle is a neighborhood that once housed a chemical plant but has become a residential area. Two percent of the children in the city live in the Triangle, and fourteen percent of these children test positive for excessive presence of toxic metals in the tissue. For children in the city who do not live in the Triangle, the rate of positive tests is only one percent. If we randomly select a child who lives in the city and she tests positive, what is the probability that she lives in the Triangle?
		\begin{solution}
		By the law of total probability
		\begin{align*}
		P(M) &= P(M|T)P(T) + P(M|T^c)P(T^c)\\
			&= 0.14 \times 0.02 +  0.01 \times 0.98\\
			&= 0.0028 + 0.0098 \\
			&= 0.0126
		\end{align*}
		and by Bayes' Rule:
				\begin{align*}
				P(T|M) &= \frac{P(M|T)P(T)}{P(M)}\\
					&= \frac{0.0028}{0.0126} = 2/9 \approx 0.22

		Suppose we randomly choose an orange from the supermarket and see that it is rotten. What is the probability that it is a \emph{Tropicana}?
		\begin{solution}
			By the law of total probability:
				\begin{align*}
				P(R) &= P(R|T)P(T) + P(R|T^c)P(T^c)\\
					&= 0.03 \times 0.4 + 0.06 \times 0.6\\
					&= 0.012 + 0.036 \\
					&= 0.048
				\end{align*}
		 and by Bayes' Rule:
			\begin{align*}
			P(T|R) &= \frac{P(R|T)P(T)}{P(R)}\\

\question Substitute $n=1$ into the pmf of a Binomial$(n,p)$ RV and show that you obtain the pmf of a Bernoulli$(p)$ RV.
	\begin{solution}
		The pmf for a Binomial$(n,p)$ RV is
		$$p(x) = {n \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$
		with support $\{0, 1, 2\hdots, n\}$. Setting $n=1$ gives,
		$$p(x) = p(x) = {1 \choose x} p^x (1-p)^{1-x}$$
		with support $\{0,1\}$. Plugging in each realization in the support, and recalling that $0! = 1$, we have
			$$p(0) = \frac{1!}{0!(1-0)!} p^0 (1-p)^{1-0} = 1 - p$$
		and
		$$p(1) = \frac{1!}{1!(1-1)!} p^1 (1-p)^0 = p$$
		which is exactly how we defined the Bernoulli Random Variable.
